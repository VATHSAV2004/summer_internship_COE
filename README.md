<h3>📌 Plagiarism Detection and Email Notification</h3>

<p>
Our system automatically checks every uploaded project for plagiarism.<br/>
If plagiarism is detected above the allowed threshold (e.g., <strong>75%</strong>), the system:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Blocks the upload.</li>
  <li>Sends an automated email alert to both the <strong>uploader</strong> and the <strong>original project owner</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Here’s a screenshot showing this feature in action:</p>
