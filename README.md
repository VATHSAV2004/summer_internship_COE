<h3>ðŸ“Œ Plagiarism Detection and Email Notification</h3>

<p>
Our system automatically checks every uploaded project for plagiarism.<br/>
If plagiarism is detected above the allowed threshold (e.g., <strong>75%</strong>), the system:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Blocks the upload.</li>
  <li>Sends an automated email alert to both the <strong>uploader</strong> and the <strong>original project owner</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Hereâ€™s a screenshot showing this feature in action:</p>

<blockquote>ðŸ“¨ The email includes details about the matched project and alerts the original author.</blockquote>
